Automated Machine Learning module


## üìä What AutoML Currently Produces

When EDA is started from the GUI or via CLI with the `--EDA` option, AutoML generates an interactive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report** as an HTML file.

## üß† Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

AutoML can automatically generate an interactive **EDA report** (HTML format) from any structured dataset via GUI or CLI. This report provides a comprehensive overview of your data before modeling, supporting informed decisions in feature engineering and preprocessing.

### üß© Key Capabilities

- **Dataset Summary**
  - Number of features and samples
  - Feature types (numeric, categorical, string, boolean)
  - Memory usage and missing value analysis
  - Table previews (head, middle, tail)

- **Per-Feature Diagnostics**
  - Summary statistics and distributions
  - Category frequencies
  - Imputation and encoding suggestions
  - Flagging of zero-inflated, highly skewed, or constant features

- **Relation Insights**
  - Correlation matrix
  - Mutual information with the target
  - Feature-target interactions

- **Optional Test Data Check**
  - Structural and statistical comparison with training data
  - Detection of mismatches and unseen categories

The report is fully HTML-based, styled for usability, and supports quick navigation through tabs and feature anchors.

## üöß What‚Äôs in Progress

The AutoML module is still under active development. The following components are being built:

* üîß Automated preprocessing pipeline (guided by EDA insights)
* üß† Model selection and baseline training
* ‚öôÔ∏è Hyperparameter optimization
* üìä Evaluation metrics and comparison tools
* üíæ Exportable pipeline (as code and artifacts)
